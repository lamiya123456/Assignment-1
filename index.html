            <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a renowned Bangladeshi economist, banker, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He founded Grameen Bank in 1983, pioneering the concept of microcredit, which provides small, low-interest loans to poor individuals, particularly women, to help them improve their economic conditions.
              In 2006, Dr. Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize, a significant achievement for both Bangladesh and the global community. He also advocates for social business, which focuses on solving social problems rather than maximizing profit.</p>
